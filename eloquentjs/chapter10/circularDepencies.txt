The first module to run is set to require.cache it loads the code, so when the second module starts
being loaded, it receives the reference to the export object of the first module. when the second module
loads, it returns to the first and loads the values into de export, as the object still the same, the
second module reference to the initially empty object now has the propertys add to it. If one of the modules,
overwrite the export and loads first, the second module will have a reference to an empty object.
